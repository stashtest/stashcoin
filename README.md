StashCoin
==============

StashCoin uses scrypt-jane POW/POS mining with modified nFactor. 
As it is right now, StashCoin is largely based on Stashcoin with some modifications.

With the modified nFactor the coin will have a small period where GPU mining is very fast and CPU mining slow. 
GPU mining will slowly decrease and become slower than it was during the start of the nFactor period.

CPU mining won't be affected by this, making CPU mining more efficient than with regular cryptocurrencies. 
The coin will start as a GPU-currency and shift into an effective hybrid of CPU and GPU-mineable coins in which both will be efficient.


StashCoin was created to serve as a vehicle to the many applications the bitcoin technology will allow us to
discover. The bitcoin technology has allowed us to create incredible ideas that will change the way we live. StashCoin aims to, eventually, move beyond that of a currency into uncharted territory. As an open source project, everyone is welcome to become part of the stashcoin community and grow with it. 


The goal for this coin is to learn and grow.
